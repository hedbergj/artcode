# A Mandala Maker

Inspired by the an [example sketch](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-kaleidoscope.html) on the P5.js webpage, this is a little web app that will help you get through the day by making sand mandalas.

Use the buttons on the top left to change your sand color. The buttons on the top left will change the symmetry of the drawing. The mirror checkbox enables/disables a mirror type symmetry.
